# Responsive Web Design

Responsive web design ensures that your website looks and works well on various devices and screen sizes. You can use media queries in CSS to make your site responsive:

```css
/* Styles.css */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Styles for screens smaller than 768px wide */
  body {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}
```
